Pak 157-5
Sarfaraz 11, Imad 16
Sub fielder Ravindra Jadeja at point and Virat Kohli at cover both make fine diving stops, underlining how much better India have been in the field than Pakistan.
And another superb stop by Jadeja!
Sarfaraz finally does get a run as he taps down the ground to long on for a single.
Imad Wasim charges the last as Jasprit Bumrah goes round the wicket and he swivels it to square leg for one
